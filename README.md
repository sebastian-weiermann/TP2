# Essential Tools and Practices for Programming Projects in AI

This TP discusses tools and good practices for doing data science and AI in Python. It covers:
- Manage virtual environments properly (with Conda or venv) to ensure reproducibility.
- Set up a Python project following best practices.
- Use Git and GitHub to ensure collaborative project tracking.
- Apply collaborative work with branch management and conflict resolution

# Setup

The code uses conda to manage virtual environments. To run the code and notebooks run
```shell
conda create -f env/Lab2_env.yml
conda activate Lab2
```
Then you should be able to run the notebooks (after selecting the correct environment as interpreter).
